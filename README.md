# customer-churn-prediction

Problem statement - As a media company, helping local small and medium sized business through digital advertising is one of our main revenue streams. We do so by running advertising campaigns on behalf of our clients on platforms such as Google and Facebook. In this exercise the task is to predict if a client will stop running advertising campaigns(churn).
